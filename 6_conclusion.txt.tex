\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have proposed two new priority functions, related to diversity. One based on the MRDL focus on diversity on the objective space while the other focus on diversity on the decision space. We then compared the results with the priority function from the MOEA/D-DRA, R.I. and the MOEA/D-DE variant.

We understand that using priority functions can improve the performance of MOEA/D-DE. We also realize that using a priority functions that is based on diversity, as the Norm gave very good results, even better than the R.I. a common priority function from the literature. Therefore, we suggest that this is a direction that should be further explore, for example in real-world problems. Surprisingly, since we expected that MRDL would give the best results in terms of improvement in performance, but it barely helped. The reason might be that to it considers the diversity of a solution against all the population. The two best priority functions consider only the a relationship of the current solution against its parent.

There are many other components and variants of MOEA/D and is interesting to combine them with the 2 norm priority function to them. Then we can better understand the relationship of priority functions based on diversity with the others components and variants of the MOEA/D framework. How to define more efficient and effective utility functions for different problems is also worth further investigation as well as verify the results of using priority function in others real-world problems.
