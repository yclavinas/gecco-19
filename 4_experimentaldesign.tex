Here, we want to verify how MOEA/D-DE performs when combined with: no priority function (none) and the priority functions 2-Norm, MRDL, relative improvement and random (control). We apply the 4 priority function into MOEA/D-DE (see algorithm~\ref{alg1}) and compare these variants into two artificial benchmark problems and the Lunar Landing real-world problem. The first benchmark used is the DTLZ functions~\cite{deb2005scalable} with 100 dimensions and $k =$ dimensions - number of objectives $+ 1$, where the number of objectives is $2$. The second benchmark is the UF functions~\cite{zhang2008multiobjective}, with 100 dimensions. 


%\subsubsection{Real World Benchmark Function}


The Lunar Landing problem is a real-world problem that simulates the selection of landing sites for lunar landers~\citep{MoonOrbitingSatellite2015}. In lunar exploration it is critical to suitable landing site of the rovers. Good landing sites ensure enough sunshine providing enough energy power supply for the rovers while in a region with scientifically interesting materials with little difficulties to the exploration. In this minimization problem, the two decision variables are the longitude and latitude with three objectives: the number of continuous shade days, the total communication time (in reality, this is a maximization problem that was inverted with the goal of consistency), and the inclination angles. This problem is considered to be a severe constrained problem, due to the presence of two craters. In values, the two constraints are defined as continuous shade days being $ < 0.05$ while inclination angles being $<0.3$

%\subsubsection{Parameter Settings}


For every combination, the population size $N = 350$, the update size $nr = 2$, the neighborhood size $T = 20$, and the neighborhood search probability $\delta_p = 0.9$. The DE mutation operator value is $phi=0.5$. The Polynomial mutation operator values are $\eta_m 20$ and $p_m = 0.03333333$~\cite{campelo2018moeadr}. The number of executions is set to 21. For each execution, the number of functions evaluations is 70000. Since the Lunar Landing is a severe constrained one, we chose the population size $N = 5050$ and the number of functions evaluations is 60000. Finally, the decomposition method used is the Simple-Lattice Design (SLD), the scalar aggregation function used is Weighted Sum (WS), the update strategy used is the Restricted update strategy and we performed a simple linear scaling of the objectives to [0, 1].


We perform statistical tests on the hypervolume (HV) metric values and Inverted Generational Distance (IGD) for measuring the quality of a set of obtained non-dominated solutions found by the algorithms on the, DTLZ and UF benchmark problem. Before calculating the HV value, the objective function was scaled between $0$ and $1$. The reference point for the HV calculation was set to $(1, 1)$. However, for the real-world Lunar Landing problem, we only perform statistical tests on the hypervolume (HV) metric values using reference point as $(1, 0, 1)$. Higher values of the HV indicate better approximations while lower values of the IGD indicate better approximations. In order to verify any statistical difference in the average performance given the different algorithms, the Pairwise Wilcoxon Rank Sum Tests was used, with confidence interval $\alpha = 0.05$ and with the Hommel adjustment method. For reproducibility the code is made available at XXX.
